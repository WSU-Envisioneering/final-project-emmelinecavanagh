    <p>I went into Web 1400 not knowing anything about coding aside from a USU class a few years ago. When I came into this class, i was already a little older than the first time I'd been introduced to it, so this was an experience where I got my feet wet immediately and a lot of things hit differently this time around. I learned how to code in HTML and CSS. I feel a lot more comfortable now than I did coming into the class, and I feel like I would be proficient enough in the future with code-related work.</p>
    <p>During this course, I thought it was interesting learning about coding. I liked how our teacher explained things in a way I could understand, and being able to follow along helped me to pick it up easier than if I'd been doing it on a computer or trying to teach myself. I really appreaciated the effort our teacher put into everything, and I liked being in the classroom at the NOORDA building. It gave me a glimpse into the future of what it'll be like to be in college. The only thing I would say is lacking is enough time to complete everything, because on Tuesdays there are the field trips. They are fun and all, but I could have used more time to get some assignments done. Beyond that, it's been an amazing experience and I'm really thankful I got the chance to do this.</p>
